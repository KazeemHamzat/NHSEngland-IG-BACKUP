# NHS England Implementation Guidance Directory

This directory contains links to guidance and documentation deemed useful to implementers of NHS England Implementation Guides (IG's) 

This directory is the starting point for all readers of NHSE IG's. The purpose of this directory is to list the IG landscape including historical IG's as well as explain the plan for NHSE IG's going forward.

## Future NHSE IG Development

All new FHIR assets will be developed in the  [NHS England Implementation Guide](https://simplifier.net/nhs-england-implementation-guide).  Domain IG's will still be created at project/programme level, to give guidance on a particular subject and help implementors understand the background, context and Use Cases of a domain. However these domain IG's FHIR Asset's and profiles will be stored in the [NHS England Implementation Guide](https://simplifier.net/nhs-england-implementation-guide).

Within the NHSE folder is an IG called [NHSE Design and Development Approach](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSE-Design-and-Development-Approach2/Home?version=current) which gives detailed guidence to NHSE IG creators.
