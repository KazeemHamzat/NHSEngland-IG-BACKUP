## Policy

 <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
 <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i><b> Important:</b> Work in progress</div>

This section details the policy for FHIR Implementations using FHIR version R4 within NHS Digital. It is currently proposed that the guidance contained here will also apply to FHIR version R5 and onwards wherever practical and allowable by the FHIR standard. 

It applies to NHS Digital assets derived from UK Core where conformance to UK Core is claimed or required. 

The policy for R4 has major differences to the STU3 policy due to the development process changing to give a closer alignment with NHS Data Dictionary, NHS Supplier Frameworks, the US Core and the FHIR standard for R4.
