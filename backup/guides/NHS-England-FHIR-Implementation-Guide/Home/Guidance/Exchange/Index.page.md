FHIR has three main types of interactions. 

- <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html" target="_blank">RESTful API</a> A *(FHIR) resource exchange* framework. A set of core search parameters can be found on the resource profile pages (see Resource Index below)
- {{pagelink:FHIRMessaging-duplicate-3}} A *messaging exchange framework*. The FHIR equivalent of HL7v2 or traditional messaging
- {{pagelink:FHIRDocuments-duplicate-3}} A *document based exchange framework*. The FHIR equivalent of HL7v3 CDA (clinical document architecture)

Which interaction should be used and general interaction guidance can be found in [Integration Patterns Book](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/our-work/nhs-digital-architecture/integration-patterns-book)
