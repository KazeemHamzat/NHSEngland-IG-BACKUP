## {{page-title}}

This page gives guidance about what is asked of a participant in the C&TA process. The documented information falls into three main types:

1. Information to help or guide participants in the C&TA process.
1. Reference information which gives further context, etc. to the information that needs to be reviewed. The referenced material is not part of the C&TA process.
1. Information which is contained in the NHS England Implementation Guide STU1 guide. This is the source material which needs to be reviewed by participants in the C&TA process.

Although not part of the C&TA process, feedback is welcome on items 1 and 2 to help improve the documentation and C&TA process. This feedback will be fed into a post C&TA retrospective which will be open to all participants.

## Instructions for raising an Issue within Simplifier
Requests and Feedback should be logged within Simplifier. The steps below higlighted the processes required to log a request or raise issues.

### Creating a Simplifier Account
Although the NHS England FHIR Assets project is in the public domain, you will need to <a href='https://simplifier.net/signup' target="_blank"> create an account</a> to raise issues. A username, email address and a chosen password are the only details needed to set up an account.

### Navigation to the NHS England FHIR Assets Project
The FHIR Assets are stored within the <a href='https://simplifier.net/NHS-England-Implementation-Guide/~introduction' target="_blank"> HL7 FHIRÂ® NHS England R4 </a> project in Simplifier.

When the change request is for a change to an existing NHS England FHIR asset, the preferred approach is to raise the issue at the level of the relevant asset.

### Create a Simplifier issue at NHS England Asset level
Issue logging at asset level is the preferred approach, as it makes triage of issues easier. A 'Feedback' tab is provided on each of the FHIR Assets page, navigate to the Feedback tab to expose the web link to the asset level issues log page.


Create a new issue and give as much detail as neccessary to help understand the problem. Email notifications will be created upon any status changes and replies to the issue.

If it is not appropriate to log an issue at the Simplifier resource level, then you should raise an issue at the project level. In this case, the title and/or issue text should identify which part of the NHS England FHIR Assets Project is the subject of the issue being raised.

Creating a Simplifier Issue at Project Level
To create a issue at the project level, navigate to the project. Once you are in the project, click on the "Issues" tab and then the "New issue" button to create a new issue.
