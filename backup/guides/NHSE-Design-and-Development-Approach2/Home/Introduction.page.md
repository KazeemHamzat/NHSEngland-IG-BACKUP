This is the design and development approach used to produce the NHS England IG. It serves several purposes, for example:

- It is to allow implementers of the NHS England Profiles to understand how and why the NHS England IG has been produced.
- To act as a guide for anyone creating a derived IG to understand the process. 
- To allow interested parties to get involved in these processes.
- To facilitate suggestions for improvement to these processes.
