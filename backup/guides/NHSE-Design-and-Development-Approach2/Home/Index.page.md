# Introduction
This is the design and development approach used to produce the NHS England IG. It serves several purposes, for example:

- It is to allow implementers of the NHS England Profiles to understand how and why the NHS England IG has been produced.
- To act as a guide for anyone creating a derived IG to understand the process. 
- To allow interested parties to get involved in these processes.
- To facilitate suggestions for improvement to these processes.

## Semantic Versioning

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible changes, MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## Pre-Release Labels
These labels will be taken from the GDS development process stages, and will be one of:

- **Discovery**: a Feasibility study. A 'No code' development. Designed to find out what users are trying to achieve, any constraints, improvement opportunities

- **Alpha**: Develop prototypes and test with users. Could be minimal functionality and potentially prototypes for any options to determine which is best

- **Private Beta**: Working version and test with invited users. Handle real transactions and work at scale. ‘Invite only’ or regional. Must Pass assessment by business and technical SME’s

- **Public Beta**: All users can participate. Version unlikely to change substantially, but still needs further testing by a wider group of implementors before becoming live

- **Live**: The live phase is about supporting the service in a sustainable way, and continuing to iterate and make improvements

- **Retiring**: Implementors notified that the service is discontinued and not to be used for new developments
